# How are electrons in an Atom distributed?
# Default configation;- 1, 4, 9, 16 -> 2, 8, 18, 32
* A maximum of 2 electrons can coexist in an atomic orbital.(See Pauli exclusion)
Therefore, the first four shells with 1, 4, 9, 16 atomic orbitals, 
respectively , can contain a maximum of 2,8,18,32.

* First shell is closer to nucleus, the second lies further and the 3rd, 4th lie
furtherst

* Shells contain subshells known as atomic orbitals.

* Each shell contains one s atomic orbital. Each second and higher shell—in addition to its s
atomic orbital—contains three degenerate p atomic orbitals. Degenerate orbitals are orbitals
that have the same energy. The third and higher shells—in addition to their s and p atomic
orbitals—contain five degenerate d atomic orbitals, and the fourth and higher shells also
contain seven degenerate f atomic orbitals.

**Degenerative orbitals are orbitals that have the same energy**

# Ground State Electronic Configation;-
of an atom describes the atomic orbitals occupied by the
atom's electrons when they are all in the availble orbitals with
the lowest energy.

* If energy is applied in the groundstate, one or more electrons
can jump into a higher-energy orbital.
