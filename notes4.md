# Diapole Moments of Bonds
A polar covalent bond has a **diapole** i.e it has a negative end
and a positive end.
Size of  a diapole is indicated by a diapole moment.

A diapole moment of a bond is equal to the magnitude of the charge
on either atom(because the partial positive charge and the partial
negative charge have the same magnitude) times the distance between 
the 2 charges.

diapole moment of a bond =  size of the charge * distance between charges

Diapole moment is measured in a unit called debyte (D).

### equations
charge of an electron = 4.80 * 10^-10 (electrostatic units or esu)
distance between any polar covalent units is 10^-8cm.

so the so 1.0 D = 1.0 * 10^-18 esu cm.

?? Is size of the charge same as diapole moment?

**Refer to  The table of  Dipole Moments of Some Common Bonds**
When a molecule has only one covalent bond, its dipole
moment is identical to the dipole moment of the bond.
e.g the dipole moment of hydrogen choloride is 1.1D because
the dipole moment of H -- CI is 1.1D

The dipole moment of a molecule with more than one covalent bond
depends on the dipole moments of all bonds in the molecule &
the geometry of the molecule.


#Electrostatic Potential Maps
Understanding polarity is essential to understanding how organic
reactions occur, becasuse the central rule governing recativity of
organic compounds is that electron-rich atoms / molecules
are attracted to electron-deficient atoms / molecules.

Electrostatic potential maps / potential maps are models that
show how charge is distributed in the molecule under the map.

Red - represents negative electrostatic potential, used for regions that
attract electron-deficient species most strongly.
Blue - represents areas with most positive electrostatic potential regions - regions that
attract electron rich species mostly
Other colors - Intermediate levels of attraction
