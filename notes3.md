# Valence & Core electrons

* Valence electrons are electrons located in the outermost shell;- This
is where bonding occurs.

* Chemical behaviour of an element depends on its electronic configaration.

* Core electrons are eleclrons located in the inner most shell of an atom.

* Elements in the same column of periodic table have the same number
of valence electrons.

**Highest energy is found in outter most atomic orbitals**
**Lowest energy is found in inner most atomic orbitals**

# Covalent bonds
According to G.N.Lewis;-
**An atom is most stable if its outer shell is either filled or contains eight electrons, and it has no electrons of higher energy**
