# Valence & Core electrons

* Valence electrons are electrons located in the outermost shell;- This
is where bonding occurs.

* Chemical behaviour of an element depends on its electronic configaration.

* Core electrons are eleclrons located in the inner most shell of an atom.

* Elements in the same column of periodic table have the same number
of valence electrons.

**Highest energy is found in outter most atomic orbitals**
**Lowest energy is found in inner most atomic orbitals**

# Covalent bonds
According to G.N.Lewis;-
**An atom is most stable if its outer shell is either filled or contains eight electrons, and it has no electrons of higher energy**

# Lewis theory / Octate Rule;-
An atom will give up, accept or share electrons to achieve a filled
outer-shell or an outer shell that contains 8 electrons. 

* ions;- Arises after loosing an electron; Ions carry charge. its typical for first-column 
elements in the periodic table to form ions because each contains
1 electron.
* electronegatives;- elements that readily acquire electrons e.g florine

# Achieving outer-shell by sharing electrons;-
Here an atom shares a pair of electrons with another atom.


# Non Polar & Polar bonds
Electronegativity is the measure of the ability for an atom to pull electrons towards itself.
**Increases from left to right in rows (periodic-table)**
**Increases from top to bottom in columns (periodic-table)**

* Polar covalent electronegativity;- Here electrons are unsymetrically distributed due to atoms having different
electrongativities ie one end of a polar covalent bond has a partial negative electrongativity and the other end has a partial negative
electronegativity.

**The greater the difference in electronegativity between bonded atoms, the more polar the bond**

* Non-polar covalent electronegativity;Here atoms are share electrons symetrically & equally and its electronegativity < 0.5

* Ionic bonding;- If electronegativity is greater than 1.9, then there's no sharing of electrons. One 
of the atoms transfers an electron to another and the resulting ions are held together by
an electro-static attraction(A force between 2 opposite charges).
