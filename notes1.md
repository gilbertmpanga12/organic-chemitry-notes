# All chemical reactions are grouped into families
# Each family can fit 1 in the four major groups;-
* Group I ;- Are electrophilic addition based reactions
* Group II;- Are neutrophilic subsititution reacions & elimination reactions
* Groupe III;- Are neutrophilic acyl substitution reactions,
neutrophilic addition rections && neutrophilic-addition elimination reactions
* Group IV;- Are electorphilic && neutrophilic aromatic reactions

Organic Chemistry was invented after debunking vital force. ie Urea was
artificially created in the lab by heating amonium cyanate.

## examples of organic compounds;-
* petroleum,plastic,nylon,proteins, enyzymes etc

## There are about 16m known organic compounds

Why carbon? It neither easily accepts electorns nor give away electrons.
It simply just shares.

It is a popular belief that natural substances—those made in nature—are
superior to synthetic ones—those made in the laboratory. Yet when a chemist
synthesizes a compound, such as penicillin or morphine, the compound
is the same in all respects as the compound synthesized in nature.

# What is the major objective of organic chemistry?
* We want to learn how organic compounds react.
# How?
Organic compounds are made up of atoms held together by covalent bonds.
When these compounds react, some of the covalent bonds break & others may form
new ones.

# Structure of the Atom
* consists of a nucleus surrounded by a dense cloud of electons.
* The nucleus consists of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons
* Electrons are negatively charged
* The nucleus is denser than electron-cloud 1800times
* Electron cloud has the most volume
**Number of a protons === Number of electrons in an uncharged atom**
# [Does charged mean count? - google it && atomic mass]

# Terminology;-
* Atomic Number;- Is the number of protons in its nucleus. Each element has a unique
atomic number e.g carbon is 6. Atomic number is a constant.
* Atomic Mass;- Is the sum of protons && neutrons. Although some elements may have same
mass number, they may have varrying neutron count, e.g 98.89% of carbon have
6 neutrons while 1.11% have 7 neutrons . Different variations of carbon atoms are called
isotopes eg c12, c13, c14
* Atomic mass;- Weighted average of its isotopes
* Atomic mass == mass number
# Half-life;- Is the time it takes for a nuclei to decay
* Molecular mass? sum of atomic mass of all atoms in a molecule.
# What is a moleucule? Is a group of one or more atoms held together by bonds.

#Isotopes && Isobars
* Isotopes;- same element with same number of protons but different number of neutrons
* Isobars;- different elements with same atomic mass.
